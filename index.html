 <h2>Condoleezza Gaynor</h2>
 <p>Hello, my name is Condoleezza Gaynor. I'm a third year Computer Science major. 
	I'm very excited about this course as I have always had a knack for web development.
    I think it is an important skill to have and it's a fun way to encourage creative innovations.
 	I do hope to leave this semester with (substantial) knowledge that will contribute to 
	my expertise which, in turn, will aid in navigating the real world easier.</p>
